# Project 1 — HTML and CSS

For this project, you’ll create a single web page about a person whom you find interesting. You must work in your own branch with the included files.

1. Log in to GitHub and fork this repository.
2. Clone your fork locally.
3. Checkout your personal branch, the one with your name.
4. Make all your HTML changes in the included file called `index.html`.
5. Make all your CSS changes in the included file called `style.css`.
6. Visit [https://fonts.google.com/](https://fonts.google.com/) and choose two fonts: one for headings and one for text. Add it to `style.css`.
7. Working in `index.html`, describe the person to the audience. Where are they from? What is their specialty? Why is this person interesting to you? **These must be your own words, not content copied from a web site.**
8. Locate two images online of this person.
9. Employ both images, using the `img` element, in your page by linking to the external URLs. **Do not download the image files into this repo.** The value to the `src` attribute should start with `http`. Use `width` or `height` to adjust the size of the images to your liking.
10. Wrap the images in links that take the user to the page where you found the images.
11. In terms of HTML, you’ll need to use some or all of the following: `h1`…`h6`, `p`, `ul`, `ol`, `section`, `div`, `img`.
12. In terms of CSS, you’ll need to use — at the very least — the following properties: `background-color`, `color`, `font`, `text-align`.
